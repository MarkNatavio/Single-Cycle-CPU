# Single-Cycle-CPU

This is a single-cycle CPU that is capable of handling the following operations:
- add
- addi
- addiu
- addu
- sub
- subu
- and
- andi
- nor
- ori
- sll
- srl
- sra
- sw
- lw
- beq
- bne
- j

This CPU was built using VHDL in QuartusPrime and simulated and tested using ModelSim. For further documentaiton on the CPU, check the report 'Natavio_Mark_May_22_2022_Final_Lab.pdf' which contains a detailed description on how the CPU was deisgned and what it can do.

# Testing
For the testing I essentially made the CPU be able to carry out similar instructions as MIPS assembly instructions
